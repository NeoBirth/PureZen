 * everything works out fine. If s~ does not yet exist, then it is also easy for r~ to use the
 * zero buffer as its output. Ideally, we'd like to remove s~ and r~ entirely from the dsp graph
 * and all objects receiving from r~ to simply refer to the buffer at s~. But for that we'd need
 * to make sure that the s~ buffer is accordingly retained and not reused before all r~ receivers
 * have had a chance to use it.
